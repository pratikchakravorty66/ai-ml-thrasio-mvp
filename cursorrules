# Cursor Rules for tesseract-backend-ml
# Software Engineering and AI Project Rules

## Core Design Principles

### Single Responsibility & Separation of Concerns
Every module or class does one thing and one thing only, keeping related behavior self‑contained.

### Open/Closed & Extension without Modification
Build on abstractions so you can add new features via inheritance or composition, not by changing tested code.

### Liskov Substitution & Interface Segregation
Design small, focused interfaces and ensure subtypes behave identically to their base types.

### Dependency Inversion & Low Coupling
Depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete classes to minimize inter‑module ripple effects.

### High Cohesion & Encapsulation
Group closely related data and behavior, exposing only what's necessary and hiding implementation details.

### DRY, KISS & YAGNI
Avoid duplication, favor simple designs, and implement features only when they're actually needed.

### Testability & CI
Inject dependencies for easy mocking, keep side effects controlled, and integrate changes continuously with automated tests.

### Continuous Refactoring
Regularly revisit and refine code structure to maintain clarity, simplicity, and adaptability.

## Project Guidelines

- No scope creep
- Think critically and independently before suggesting refactorings, rather than just being an agreeable agent
- If you are unsure about an answer then please be humble enough to go through the official content present in the web

## Development Environment

- Use .venv as the Python virtual environment
- Activate the virtual environment before running commands such as tests
- Manual command execution preferred - provide commands to copy and paste rather than executing automatically

## Project Focus

This is a Tesseract backend ML project with focus on:
- PDF processing and OCR
- Label Studio integration
- Google Cloud Storage integration
- Document type processing (bank statements, pay stubs, allotment proofs, split direct deposit proofs)
- Asynchronous processing with proper error handling and retries
